# Gateway-Java
This repo contains all the project files for Johns Hopkins University Gateway Computing with Java Fall 2022 projects.

This course introduces fundamental programming concepts and techniques, and is intended for all who plan to develop computational artifacts or intelligently deploy computational tools in their studies and careers. Topics covered include the design and implementation of algorithms using variables, control structures, arrays, functions, files, testing, debugging, and structured program design. Elements of object-oriented programming. algorithmic efficiency and data visualization are also introduced. Students deploy programming to develop working solutions that address problems in engineering, science and other areas of contemporary interest that vary from section to section.

The 5 projects included in this repo are as follows:
Project 1: Mondrian Art
Project 2: The Wordle Game
Project 3: Car Data Analysis
Project 4: Rectangle of Rectangles
